# PHUSE-ER-2024 Conference Presentation
This repository contains the slides for my talk "Leveraging Data Science & Analytics to Optimize Clinical Trial Executio" at PHUSE EU 2024 on November 12, 2024 in Strasbourg, France.

# Abstract
Through innovative leadership, we transformed a Clinical Data Management team by implementing open-source R programming for automated data cleaning and reporting. This evolved into two interconnected teams: Clinical Data Management and Clinical Data Analytics & Reporting, collaborating to efficiently execute clinical trials. Building upon this foundation, we are now establishing a pioneering Clinical Data Science program. By applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we aim to proactively address critical clinical development questions, enabling data-driven optimization of our clinical trial processes.  This presentation will showcase our journey of innovation, discussing the strategic vision, practical implementation, and tangible impact of leveraging data science to streamline operations.  We will share insights on fostering a culture of continuous improvement, upskilling team members, and harnessing advanced analytics to drive success. Attendees will gain valuable takeaways on leading transformative initiatives, empowering teams to push boundaries, and unlocking the full potential of data science in the clinical domain.
